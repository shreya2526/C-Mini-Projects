Welcome to the Online Testing System, a Django-based web application designed to facilitate online testing and assessment. This project offers a seamless user experience, starting with user registration and login. New users can sign up by providing a unique username, a secure password, and their real name. Upon successful registration, a confirmation page will prompt them to log in.

Logging in is a breeze with just your username and password, and users can clear the form if they make any input errors. Once logged in, users are presented with four options: taking tests with 1, 3, or 5 questions, and reviewing their test history.

A key feature of this system is its robust database management. Each username is inserted into the database only once, preventing duplication. Moreover, users can easily track their progress by accessing their test history, which displays test results along with timestamps. The system calculates an average point based on past test results, allowing users to gauge their performance over time.

Online Testing System simplifies the process of conducting online tests and monitoring progress, making it an ideal solution for educational institutions, training programs, or anyone looking to administer online assessments efficiently. Start testing and tracking your progress today!
